# Wine_Quality_using_R
We try to establish a relationship between the attributes of wine and the quality. Our aim is to analyze how each variable impacts the quality. This model could be used improving wine, targeting customers depending on their taste buds, rating wines etc.
Wine is a traditional alcoholic drink liked and consumed all over the globe. Typically, there are 2 types of wine, red wine and white wine. For our case study we will focus on red wine. There is huge variation in the taste of red wine based on how it is produced, its geographic location, the raw material etc. Our red wine dataset contains 1599 samples of wine with its 11 attributes and 1 quality variable.
